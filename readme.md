## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
NUS ISS offers a multitude of degree and professional conversion programs which are very popular not only in Singapore but also in many of the south east Asian and south Asian countries. Even within Singapore, IT is becoming a most sought-after subject, because of the emerging state-of-the-art technologies and the job and start up opportunities it provides.
The Singapore Government is making significant fund allocation for Skill future credits in its push for a smart nation. It aims to develop Infocom leaders who can achieve business & organisation innovation and also to ensure enough talent pool of employees for multinational companies in the thriving economy.
In order to meet the growing national and international demand, our team of 4 Singapore residents are tasked with building a chat bot which can handle queries of the aspiring students. This chatbot will provide a friendly user interface and will respond to users queries on ISS programs, courses and related information
